AchillesChat

AchillesChat is a persona-based chatbot built with ASP.NET Core and ML.NET.
It simulates friendly conversations with Achilles and Patroclus from The Song of Achilles.

The chatbot uses a custom knowledge base, ML.NET similarity scoring, and fallback small talk. Optionally, it can integrate with OpenAI GPT for out-of-scope questions.

üöÄ Features

Knowledge Base Q&A

Define questions, answers, speaker (Achilles, Patroclus, Both), and optional keywords.


ML.NET Similarity

Uses FeaturizeText() to vectorize Q&A and user queries.

Computes cosine similarity to find the best matching answer.


Fallback System

Responds with small talk or unsure replies if no high-confidence match is found.


Persona Simulation

Each answer is tagged with the speaker.

Keeps conversations in-character.


Optional GPT Integration

Extendable to handle queries outside the knowledge base.

‚ö° How It Works

1. User asks a question ‚Üí ChatController receives it.


2. ML Similarity ‚Üí MLSimilarityService computes similarity score with all Q&A entries.


3. Threshold Check ‚Üí If top score > 0.55 ‚Üí returns answer from Q&A.


4. Fallback ‚Üí If no confident match:

Returns a small talk reply or an unsure response.

Optionally, queries OpenAI GPT for dynamic in-character reply.

üîë Knowledge Base Example

new QAItem
{
    Question = "Who are you?",
    Answer = "I am Achilles, son of Peleus and Thetis.",
    Speaker = Speaker.Achilles,
    Keywords = new[] { "identity", "hero", "name" }
},
new QAItem
{
    Question = "What is your bond with Achilles?",
    Answer = "Achilles and I share a bond deeper than comradeship.",
    Speaker = Speaker.Patroclus,
    Keywords = new[] { "friendship", "relationship", "bond" }
}

üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally

Prerequisites

.NET 7 SDK or later

(Optional) OpenAI API Key if GPT fallback enabled


Steps

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/e-l-z-a/AchillesChat.git
cd AchillesChat

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Run project
dotnet run

Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser to chat with Achilles/Patroclus.

üîß Configuration

Similarity Threshold

Set in MLSimilarityService.cs or when calling FindBestMatch():

float threshold = 0.55f; // ignore low-confidence matches

OpenAI API Key (Optional)

appsettings.json:


{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}

‚ú® Future Improvements

Use sentence embeddings (OpenAI / HuggingFace) for more accurate similarity.

Add conversation memory to remember context.

Enhance personality depth (emotions, moods).

Improve frontend (chat bubbles, typing animations).
